# Rutgers-CS211-Computer-Architecture

There are projects for Computer Architecture in this repository. The course was taught by Prof. Santosh Nagarakatte.

The first project pa1 is just coding different data structures in C like list, heap, trees, etc. 

The second project pa2 has 2 parts: 1). Solve a hexadoku. It is a 16 x 16 sudoku with hexadecimal numbers. 
                                    2). Build an alogrithm to predict the future price of houses given its state and current prices.
                                    
The Third project pa3 is actually a "bomblab" which means we are given an Assembly code and we need to decode the code to find out the hidden word. 
Half a point gets cut every time you decode it wrong. 

The fourth project pa4 is to design a cache memory based on spatial locality principal.
